# Small Basic EV3

EV3 Basic is an alternative method of programming for EV3 Mindstorms. It uses Microsoft Small Basic IDE and its corresponding EV3 extension.

For more information visit, [Microsoft Small Basic](https://smallbasic-publicwebsite.azurewebsites.net/) or [EV3 Basic Extension](https://sites.google.com/site/ev3basic/ev3-basic-programming).

## Why use Small Basic?

You might already be familiar with EV3-G and EV3 Classroom.

However, they both come with their sets of issues. For example, EV3-G is known to be very laggy, particularly with large codebases;

EV3 Classroom and Small Basic EV3 do not support the use of HiTechnic Color Sensors.

Small Basic doesn't require you to load up an SD card and spend a long time âŒ› just to wait for a firmware update.

At the same time , you can also you full fludged programming techniques such as arrays that are not supported in EV3-G or EV3 Classroom.
