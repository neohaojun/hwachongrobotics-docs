# Hwa Chong Robotics

**Hwa Chong Robotics** is a place for like-minded and passionate students to explore the intricacies of the field of Robotics. We build robots or various competitions and are the only school-based robotics club in Singapore that specializes across three major robotics competitions, namely RoboCup, VEX and LEGO (NRC/WRO).

Our goal is to expose our members to as many disciplinaries of robotics as possible in an environment that encourages self-directed learning and the freedom to experiment. Ultimately, we wish to cultivate our shared passion for robotics together, such that every member can contribute to a society where automation and AI is becoming increasingly commonplace.

As a completely self-reliant CCA with no external trainer, our members have to commit more time and effort to figure things out as we alone, are responsible for our successes and failures. We aim to use this site as an avenue to share our expertise and provide a stepping stone for whoever might want to learn more about the field of Robotics, but might not have had the time or resources to do so, to engage in such deep exploration.
